            <p>
                Hello! I'm Merve, a UX/UI designer with a background in interior
                architecture, where I learned to shape spaces that feel
                intuitive and meaningful. Over five years in the design industry
                taught me how people interact with environments â€” lessons I now
                bring into the digital world. As I transition into web
                development, I'm passionate about blending aesthetics,
                usability, and function to craft experiences that feel as
                natural as stepping into a well-designed space.
            </p>
