                    <h2>Kisir</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kisir is a beloved traditional Turkish salad made from
                        fine bulgur wheat, and it holds a special place in
                        almost every Turkish household. For me, it's more than
                        just a salad — it's a symbol of togetherness, often
                        prepared for family gatherings, tea times, or when
                        friends come over for an afternoon chat. It's made with
                        fine bulgur, tomato and pepper paste, olive oil, lemon
                        juice, and plenty of fresh herbs like parsley and mint.
                        I love how its flavors are both tangy and slightly spicy
                        — a true reflection of Turkish cuisine. In my hometown,
                        we often serve kisir with lettuce leaves and a cup of
                        tea when friends visit. To me, it's a taste of home and
                        shared moments around the table.

                    <h2>Baklava</h2>
                    <p>
                        Baklava is the most popular Turkish dessert, known for
                        its golden layers of flaky pastry, crushed pistachios,
                        and sweet syrup. Contrary to popular belief, most people
                        in Türkiye don't actually know how to make it — but in
                        my hometown, Gaziantep, baklava is part of everyday
                        life. You can find it in almost every bakery, freshly
                        baked and perfectly crisp. I grew up surrounded by its
                        rich aroma, and for me, baklava isn't just a dessert;
                        it's a proud symbol of my city's culinary heritage and
                        craftsmanship.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm originally from Gaziantep in Turkiye, where many
                    civilizations lived during centuries. Growing up surrounded
                    by rich flavors and stories of the past inspired my passion
                    for cooking. In my blog, I share recipes that blend
                    traditional Gaziantep cuisine with modern techniques, always
                    keeping authenticity at heart. Each dish tells a story — of
                    family, culture, and the joy of sharing food.
