How to Make Hummus
Soak and Cook Chickpeas. Place 1 cup dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with plenty of water (the beans will expand.) Soak overnight. When ready, drain the chickpeas and place them in a medium-sized heavy cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. You should end up with about 3 cups of cooked chickpeas. If using canned chickpeas, give them a quick 20-minute simmer in plenty of water to help soften them some more.
Peel the chickpeas. Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. Take a handful of chickpeas and rub them under running water to remove the skins. Discard skins. Let the chickpeas cool completely before using. Reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons of chickpeas to garnish the finished hummus later.
Puree the chickpeas. Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor fitted with the S-blade. Run the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like paste.
Finish the hummus. While the food processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 to 5 minutes. Check, and if the consistency is too thick, run the processor and slowly add a little water. Blend until you reach the desired silky-smooth consistency. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or so before serving.
Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish. Spread the hummus in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil. Add the reserved chickpeas to the middle, if youâ€™d like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges, your favorite veggies, and some warm pita bread.
