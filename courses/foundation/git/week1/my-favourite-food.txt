How to Make Kisir
This bulgur salad is best served cold. Try to give the bulgur enough time to chill in your fridge. Here are the steps:
Get ready. Bring just over 2 cups of water to a boil. 
Cook the bulgur. Place 2 cups of fine or extra fine bulgur in a mixing bowl and pour about 1 cup of boiling water over it. Stir. The bulgur should immediately absorb the water. Pour another 1 cup of boiling water over top, enough to just cover the bulgur. Cover the bowl and set aside until the bulgur is tender and has absorbed all of the water, about 15 minutes.
Prepare the paste. In a small pan over medium heat, stir together 3 tablespoons olive oil with 1/4 cup tomato paste, 3 tablespoons Turkish red pepper paste, 1 teaspoon Urfa Biber, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, and a big dash of salt. Stir until the pasted, oil, and spices have combined. 
Pour the paste mixture over the bulgur. Add 2 tablespoons of pomegranate molasses, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix well (or knead with gloved hands as is traditional) until the bulgur is fully coated in the paste. 
Cool. Set the bulgur in the fridge to cool while you chop the rest of the ingredients. 
Prepare the veggies and herbs. Trim and finely chop 6 green onions (both white and green parts). Chop enough parsley leaves and tender stems to yield 1 cup chopped parsley. Dice 3 tomatoesâ€”if they are too soft or watery, you may want to halve them and squeeze out the seeds over your sink before chopping.
Mix the kisir salad. Once the bulgur has fully cooled, mix in the chopped onions, parsley, and tomatoes. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking. 
Finish and serve. Garnish with more fresh parsley and serve.
