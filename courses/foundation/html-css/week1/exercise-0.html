            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm a UX/UI Designer, having a background in interior
                architecture. After I moved to Denmark, I would like to change
                my career path, due to the lack of the opportunities in my
                former field.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been living in <strong>Bagsv√¶rd</strong> in Copenhagen,
                with my husband and our cat <strong>Humus</strong>. I like to do
                <em>digital illustrations,</em> <em>knitting,</em>
                <em>pottery,</em> and <em>hiking</em> when I have some free
                time.
            </p>

            <h3>My Favorite Movies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>About Dry Grasses</li>
                <li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</li>
                <li>Interstellar</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three movies are my favorite movies.</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Books</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>My Sweet Orange Tree</li>
                <li>The Midnight Library</li>
                <li>Madonna in a Fur Coat</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I would say these three books are my favorite, though
                <strong>My Sweet Orange Tree</strong> is my all time favorite
                book.
